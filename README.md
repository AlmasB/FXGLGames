This repo contains sample games built with <a href="https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL">FXGL</a> Game Library.
Each game focuses on one or two aspects of FXGL, e.g. Drop focuses on bare minimums, Pac-man focuses on AI, etc.

Checkout [this commit](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGLGames/commit/a0821c76ba4a7a64dba4f9ec6f182827d909561c) for Java 8 code for all projects (FXGL 0.5.4).
All projects will eventually be upgraded to Java 11 code (FXGL 11.0+).

## Run
```bash
cd PROJECT_NAME
mvn javafx:run
```

## Build for Mobile

Follow latest instructions from [client-samples](https://github.com/gluonhq/client-samples#build-and-run-the-samples). A relevant extract is copied below.

For example, to build Breakout for Android (can only build from Linux):

1. Download [GraalVM](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases/tag/vm-20.2.0) zip: `graalvm-ce-java11-linux-amd64-20.2.0.tar.gz`

2. Set `GRAALVM_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables to the GraalVM installation directory. For example:

```
export GRAALVM_HOME=/opt/graalvm-ce-java11-20.2.0
export JAVA_HOME=$GRAALVM_HOME
```   

3.

```
cd Breakout
mvn clean client:build
mvn client:package

// connect your Android device and allow it installation over USB

mvn client:install
```

You can now run the game from Android, or you can run with logging from Linux: `mvn client:run`.
